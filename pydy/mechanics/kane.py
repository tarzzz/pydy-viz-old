class Kane(object):
    """Kane's method object.

    This object is used to do the "book-keeping" as you go through and form
    equations of motion in the way Kane presents in:
    Kane, T., Levinson, D. Dynamics Theory and Applications. 1985 McGraw-Hill

    The attributes are for equations in the form [M] udot = forcing.

    Very Important Warning: simp is set to True by default, to the advantage of
    smaller, simpler systems. If your system is large, it will lead to
    slowdowns; however turning it off might have negative implications in
    numerical evaluation. Care needs to be taken to appropriately reduce
    expressions generated with simp==False, as they might be too large
    themselves. Computing the relationship between independent and dependent
    speeds (when dealing with non-holonomic systems) benefits from simp being
    set to True (during the .speeds() method); the same is true for
    linearization of non-holonomic systems.  If numerical evaluations are
    unsucessful with simp==False, try setting simp to True only for these
    methods; this provides some compromise between the two options.

    Examples
    ========

    This is a simple example for a one defree of freedom translational
    spring-mass-damper.

    In this example, we first need to do the kinematics.
    This involves creating generalized speeds and coordinates and their
    derivatives.
    Then we create a point and set its velocity in a frame::

        >>> from sympy import symbols
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import dynamicsymbols, ReferenceFrame
        >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Point, Particle, Kane
        >>> q, u = dynamicsymbols('q u')
        >>> qd, ud = dynamicsymbols('q u', 1)
        >>> m, c, k = symbols('m c k')
        >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')
        >>> P = Point('P')
        >>> P.set_vel(N, u * N.x)

    Next we need to arrange/store information in the way the Kane requires.
    The kinematic differential equations need to be stored in a dict.
    A list of forces/torques must be constructed, where each entry in the list
    is a (Point, Vector) or (ReferenceFrame, Vector) tuple, where the Vectors
    represent the Force or Torque.
    Next a particle needs to be created, and it needs to have a point and mass
    assigned to it.
    Finally, a list of all bodies and particles needs to be created::

    >>> kd = [qd - u]
    >>> FL = [(P, (-k * q - c * u) * N.x)]
    >>> pa = Particle('pa', P, m)
    >>> BL = [pa]

    Finally we can generate the equations of motion.
    First we create the Kane object and supply an inertial frame.
    Next we pass it the generalized speeds.
    Then we pass it the kinematic differential equation dict.
    Next we form FR* and FR to complete: Fr + Fr* = 0.
    We have the equations of motion at this point.
    It makes sense to rearrnge them though, so we calculate the mass matrix and
    the forcing terms, for E.o.M. in the form: [MM] udot = forcing, where MM is
    the mass matrix, udot is a vector of the time derivatives of the
    generalized speeds, and forcing is a vector representing "forcing" terms::

        >>> KM = Kane(N)
        >>> KM.coords([q])
        >>> KM.speeds([u])
        >>> KM.kindiffeq(kd)
        >>> (fr, frstar) = KM.kanes_equations(FL, BL)
        >>> MM = KM.mass_matrix
        >>> forcing = KM.forcing
        >>> rhs = MM.inv() * forcing
        >>> rhs
        [-(c*u(t) + k*q(t))/m]
        >>> KM.linearize()[0]
        [0, 1]
        [k, c]

    Please look at the documentation pages for more information on how to
    perform linearization and how to deal with dependent coordinates & speeds,
    and how do deal with bringing non-contributing forces into evidence.

        Note that for linearization, it is assumed that time is not perturbed,
        but only coordinates and positions. The "forcing" vector's jacobian is
        computed with respect to the state vector in the form [Qi, Qd, Ui, Ud].
        This is the "f_lin_A" matrix.

        It also finds any non-state dynamicsymbols and computes the jacobian of
        the "forcing" vector with respect to them. This is the "f_lin_B"
        matrix; if this is empty, an empty matrix is created.

        Consider the following:
        If our equations are: [M]qudot = f, where [M] is the full mass matrix,
        qudot is a vector of the deriatives of the coordinates and speeds, and
        f in the full forcing vector, the linearization process is as follows:
        [M]qudot = [f_lin_A]qu + [f_lin_B]y, where qu is the state vector,
        f_lin_A is the jacobian of the full forcing vector with respect to the
        state vector, f_lin_B is the jacobian of the full forcing vector with
        respect to any non-speed/coordinate dynamicsymbols which show up in the
        full forcing vector, and y is a vector of those dynamic symbols (each
        column in f_lin_B corresponds to a row of the y vector, each of which
        is a non-speed/coordinate dynamicsymbol).

        To get the traditional state-space A and B matrix, you need to multiply
        the f_lin_A and f_lin_B matrices by the inverse of the mass matrix.
        Caution needs to be taken when inverting large symbolic matrices;
        substituting in numerical values before inverting will work better.

        A tuple of (f_lin_A, f_lin_B, other_dynamicsymbols) is returned.
